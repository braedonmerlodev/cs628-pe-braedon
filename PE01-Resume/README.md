# Input
- When it comes to input recieved from this system, there is currently no areas within the code that requires any user input. THe only thing a user can do within the resume app I just created is view my resume and click a link to look at the source code. 

# Process
- This is a fairly simple react app, there is no middleware component, meaning there is no need for processing data validations, calculations, etc. There is no no need to process any data for output.

# Output
- As mentioned above, since there is input or process required within this app, their is no data that is generated for output.It is simply an app to review my resume and to outline the source code to view the web app resume that I created.
