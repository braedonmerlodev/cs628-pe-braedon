# Recipe Management Application - Input, Process, Output Analysis

This document outlines the input, process, and output of the Recipe Management Application, along with a data flow analysis.

## Input

The application receives input from the following sources:

* **User Interface:**
    * Form fields for entering and editing recipe details (title, ingredients, instructions, etc.).
    * Navigation actions (buttons, links) for interacting with the application.
* **API:**
    * HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for performing recipe operations (create, read, update, delete).
* **Database:**
    * MongoDB connection string for establishing a database connection.
    * Seed data for initializing the database with sample recipes.

## Process

The application processes data through the following layers:

* **Frontend:**
    * React components render the user interface.
    * State management handles user interactions and data updates.
    * Axios library makes API calls to the backend server.
* **Backend:**
    * Express server handles incoming HTTP requests.
    * Routes define the API endpoints for CRUD operations.
* **Database:**
    * MongoDB stores and manages recipe documents.
    * Schema validation ensures data integrity.

## Output

The application provides output in the following forms:

* **User Interface:**
    * Recipe list displayed as cards, providing a summary of each recipe.
    * Detailed recipe views showing complete recipe information.
    * Action feedback (e.g., success messages, error notifications).
* **API:**
    * JSON responses containing recipe data.
    * Appropriate HTTP status codes indicating the success or failure of API requests.
* **Database:**
    * Stored recipe documents in MongoDB.
    * Query results returned from the database.

## Data Flow

The application's data flow can be broken down into the following scenarios:

* **Creating a Recipe:**
    1.  User submits a recipe form in the UI.
    2.  The API validates the submitted data.
    3.  The API stores the validated data in the MongoDB database.
    4.  The UI updates to display the newly created recipe.
* **Viewing Recipes:**
    1.  User navigates to the recipe list in the UI.
    2.  The API fetches recipe data from the MongoDB database.
    3.  The UI displays the fetched recipes.
* **Editing/Deleting a Recipe:**
    1.  User modifies or deletes a recipe in the UI.
    2.  The API updates or deletes the corresponding recipe in the MongoDB database.
    3.  The UI reflects the changes made to the recipe.
