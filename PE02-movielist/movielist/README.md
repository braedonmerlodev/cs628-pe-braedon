# Input
This project used state with an array of objects. Each object contained a movie with a title, genre & release year. Since the data was obtained via an array within state, no input was required by the user to obtain movie data.

# Process

This is a fairly simple react app, there is no middleware component, meaning there is no need for processing data validations, calculations, etc. Since there is no database being used, there is no need to process data to make sure output is accurate.

# Output
The output for this project was based on the data within the array. We created a list that could be sorted by genre. The output was determined by the genre selected by the user, and the application recommended the appropriate movie based on that genre.
